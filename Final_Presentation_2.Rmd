# Introduction


**Potential Topics**
- Fish populations in the Salmon river 
- National Park visitation and Social Media

<br>


**Motivation**
- Curious about state politics & how it effects decision making
- Energy is a good metric to measure this 
- Interesting independently 

<br>

**Hypothesis**
- Conservative states use less energy than is optimal



---

# Why is this important?

  - Do state politics interfere with decision making?
  
  <br>
    
  - Are states acting in their own best interest?
   
  <br>
  
    
  - Understand these dynamics to best inform policy

# Data

**Energy usage statistics by state**
       - US Energy Information Administration
        
        
        
**2000-2020 presidential election data**
        - MIT Election and Data Science Lab & the Harvard Dataverse 
        
        
        
**2022 State Governors** 
        - Webscraped from Wikipedia
---

# Data Cleaning Process

**Energy Use Data**
- This dataset needed the most work
- Removed rows containing non-data entries
- Removed variables unnecessary to my analysis
- Applied transformations to key variables 
    - (* = 0 | --, NM = N/A)

**Election Data**
- Clean Dataset...tricky variable creation
- Summed votes for candidates within states to determine victor
- Dummy variable = 1 if a state voted for Trump

**Governor Data**
- Webscraped Wikipedia Table
- Easy to clean and process
- Dummy variable = 1 if a state has a republican governor

---

# Question 1

**Are there discernible differences between renewable energy use based on political affiliation between states?**

Three Categories

- **Red** 
  - Voted for Trump in 2020
  - Republican Governor
    
- **Blue**
  - Voted for Biden in 2020
  - Democratic Governor
    
- **Purple**
   - One and not the other

# Renewable Energy by Political Category
```{r, echo=F, eval=TRUE}

# Analysis


  - **Trends**
  <br>
  
  - **Outliers**
  <br>
  
  - **Notable patterns**

# Renewable Energy by Political Category
```{r, out.height="100%", echo=F}

# Comparisons

 - Now, I want to compare CO2 emissions to the amount of renewable energy states generate
---
# Version 1
```{r, out.width="100%", echo=F}
include_graphics("graph_6.png")
```
---
# Version 2
```{r, out.width="100%", echo=F}
include_graphics("graph_6.0.png")
```
---
# Version 3
```{r, out.width="100%", echo=F}
include_graphics("graph_6.0.1.png")
```
---
# Takeaways

  - Texas is the biggest polluter in the US.
  
  <br>
  
  - Three states emit more than their fair share.
  
  <br>
  
  - Important to transform data when necessary.
